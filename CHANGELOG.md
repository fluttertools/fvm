- Added support for new Flutter 1.17.0+ [versioning scheme](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/flutter-announce/b_EcYtyo8Q4/2QSfdp2aBwAJ) -
  The new versioning scheme includes changes to tag names and thus also version names for FVM. When reinstalling Flutter versions <1.17.0, the FVM install-path will change, potentially breaking projects that rely on the install-path.
  The install-path will change from `~/fvm/versions/1.15.17` to `~/fvm/versions/v1.15.17`. Make sure to change this in your IDE configuration.
