# Custom Flutter Version (Forks)

You can use custom Flutter versions (forks) within the FVM cache.

To do that, you have to prefix the version with `custom_` and then add the name of the version. For example, if you want to use a custom version of Flutter, you can do the following:

```bash
fvm use [custom_name]
```

<Callout type="info">

Run `fvm list` to view the cache directory and the current cached versions.
