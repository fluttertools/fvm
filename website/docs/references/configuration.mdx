Configure FVM and IDEs for better support for different development environments.

## Project

FVM will create a relative symlink in your project from `.fvm/flutter_sdk` to the cache of the selected version. Add it to your `.gitignore`

```yaml title=".gitignore"
.fvm/flutter_sdk
```

## FVM

### Cache Directory

You can configure the **fvm** cache directory by setting `FVM_HOME` environment variable. If nothing is set the default **fvm** path will be used. You are also able to change the directory by setting the `--cache-path` on the config. See below

### Config

There are some configurations which you can change on FVM. **All settings set on CLI are compatible with the Sidekick(GUI)**.

### Different Flutter Repo

You can use a different Flutter repo, a fork or as a local cache, by setting the `FVM_GIT_CACHE` environment variable.

#### List config

```bash
> fvm config
```

#### Set cache path

Location where Flutter SDK versions will be stored. If nothing is set, the default will be used.

```bash
> fvm config --cache-path <CACHE_PATH>
```

## IDE

:::info
You might have to restart your IDE and the Flutter debugger to make sure it uses the latest version of the configurations in some situations.

### VS Code

#### Option 1 - Automatic Switching (Recommended)

You can add the version symlink for a dynamic switch. VS Code will always use the version selected within the project for all IDE tooling. Also, remove the Flutter SDK from search to make things easier. Just create a folder inside the project called `.vscode` and then create a file called `settings.json` and add the following file:


```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPath": ".fvm/flutter_sdk",
  // Remove .fvm files from search
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/.fvm": true
  },
  // Remove from file watching
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.fvm": true
  }
}
```

Execute `fvm use <desired version>` in the project root directory; If configured correctly, this will switch the version used on VSCode. If you are having issues, click on the Flutter version text on the status bar of VSCode, to show all the current SDKs installed on your machine. Select auto-detect, which will check `.vscode` dir inside your project and then change your Flutter SDK depending on the fvm config or manually select the Flutter SDK from fvm cache directory.


#### Option 2 - View all SDKs (Manual switching)

VSCode has the ability for you to switch between all cached Flutter SDKs using `Flutter: Change SDK`.

:::info

Use command `fvm list` to show you the cache path to the versions.

#### List all versions installed by FVM

You can see all the versions installed by FVM in VS Code by just providing path to `versions` directory. In the following example path for macOS, replace `$USER` with your username:

```json
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPaths": ["/Users/$USER/fvm/versions"]
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify only selected versions. The following snippet will cause VS Code to show only `stable` and `dev` versions of Flutter.

```json
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPaths": [
    "/Users/$USER/fvm/versions/stable",
    "/Users/$USER/fvm/versions/dev"
  ]
}
```

To change current Flutter version open a project and select `Flutter: Change SDK` in the command palette. You should see all the versions as depicted in the following screenshot.
