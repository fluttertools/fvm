## Use

Sets Flutter SDK Version you would like to use in a project. If version does not exist it will ask if you want to install.

```bash
Usage:
    fvm use {version}

Option:
    -h, --help     Print this usage information.
    -f, --force    Skips Flutter project checks.
    -p, --pin      Pins latest release channel instead of channel itself.
        --flavor   Sets version for a project flavor
```

If you are starting a new project and plan on using `fvm flutter create` you will have to use the `--force` flag
